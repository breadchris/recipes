Here I'm using old-fashioned oats, quick oats, and combination of old-fashioned oats, quick oats and ground oats.\n\nFor these healthy cookies besides bananas and oats I use raisins, but you can feel free to replace raisins with chocolate chips, chopped walnuts or almonds, or different dried fruits.\n\nBanana oatmeal cookies are perfect for school lunchboxes and as a healthy snack for your kids.\n\n3-INGREDIENT BANANA OATMEAL COOKIES\nIngredients:\n2 ripe bananas\n1.5 cups old-fashioned oats (or quick oats) (135g)\n1/3 cup raisins (50g)\n\nPreparation:\nIn a bowl, mash the bananas using a fork, add oats and mix well until combined. If the mixture is too wet (which depends on the size of the bananas), add some more oats.\n\nAdd the raisins and give a final mix.\n\nScoop about 2 tablespoons of cookie mixture and spread on a lined baking sheet. Spread the mixture and using your hands form into a cookie shape.\n\nFor medium sized cookies bake for 12 minutes at 350 degrees. If making small cookies bake for 9 minutes, and for larger size cookies bake for 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhen baked transfer to a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes, and they're ready to dig in.\n\nCool completely before storing in the box.\n\nEnjoy!",
